    /********* Keithon Notes and Ideas for this file ***********/

        // I think personally that we should make some sort of class that wraps
        // the three following classes. In the first three tabs 'Home' 'Trending' & 'Subscriptions'
        // all have the same exact parts. The 'trending' and 'Subscriptions' tabs both
        // have buttons in their that can have interchangable responsabilities (I think).
        // Finally, the 'Subscriptions' tab has one more extra thing...
        // the modal/pop up thing that can be exited by the user.

        // I'd wrap it like this (I'll go ahead and implement this on the other files):

        class MainView : TopNav, ContentView, BottomNav {

        }

    /** Brad updates **/
    Agree on your ideas for collecting each view into a higher-level class! I might go even further and say each of the 5 tabs (home/trending/subs/etc) has common parts to it (being: topnav, content view, bottom nav). What's inside of the ContentView class changes depending on the MainView page you're looking at, but the fact that it's a scrolling list of objects means we don't necessarily have to care about what's inside of that scrolling list to be able to identify it as a property common to each screen.

    I'd write your MainView class something like the following, assuming MainView inherits from the standard iOS base UIViewController Class as a starting point:

    class MainTabVC: UIViewController {

        /** Properties **/
        var topNav : TopNav
        var contentView : ContentView
        var botNav : BottomNav
    }
    /** End **/

class TopNav {

    /** Properties **/
    // 1.) logoIcon: an instance of class LogoIcon, which inherits from class Icon
    // 2.) actionIconList: an array of objects of class ActionIcon, which all inherit from class Icon

    /** Methods/Functions List **/

    /** Delegates/Extensions **/
    1.) iconTappedDelegate : Listens for any icons to be tapped, and changes screen accordingly.
}

class ContentView {

    /** Properties **/
    // 1.) videoList: an array of objects of class VideoListView

    /** Methods/Functions List **/
    // 1.) videoListDidScroll: captures & handles user scrolling. When user scrolls, move content in appropriate direction.
}

class BottomNav {
    /** Properties **/
    var tabIconList: an array of objects of class TabIcon, which inherits from class Icon.

    /** Methods/Functions List **/

    /** Delegates/Extensions **/
    // 1.) iconTappedDelegate : Listens for any icons to be tapped, and changes screen accordingly.
}
